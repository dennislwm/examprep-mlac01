# 5. Execution
## 5.1. Set up replication for an S3 bucket

1. Navigate to your AWS console > S3.
2. Create a new source bucket or choose an existing S3 bucket.
3. Create a new target bucket or choose an existing S3 bucket (during replication set up).
4. Enable versioning for both the source and target buckets.
5. Select your source bucket > Management > Replication Rules.
6. Click on Create replication rule.
  - Replication rule name: `Demo replication`.
  - Status: `Enabled`.
  - Choose a rule scope: `Apply to all objects in the bucket`.
  - Destination: `Choose a bucket in this account`.
    - Bucket name: `my-replica-bucket`.
  - IAM role: `Choose from existing IAM roles`.
    - IAM role: `my-replica-iam-role`.
  - Click Save.
7. You will be given the option to replicate existing objects with a one-time Batch Operations job.
  - Existing objects: `No, do not replicate existing objects`.
  - Click Submit.
8. By default, deletion markers are not enabled.
9. Select your source bucket > Management > Select your replication rule > Edit rule.
  - Under Additional replication options > Enable `Delete marker replication`.
  - Note: Permanent deletion of objects will not be replicated.
  - Click Save.
10. You have successfully set up replication for an S3 bucket, with an optional deletion markers replication.

# 6. Security and Compliance
## 6.1. Set up a security policy for an S3 bucket

An AWS IAM principal can access an S3 object if:
1. The User or Role IAM policy ALLOWs it; OR
  - The Resource Bucket Policy ALLOWs it;
2. AND there is no explicit DENY.

1. Setup a User IAM policy such that:
  - S3 bucket API calls are allowed for a specific user from IAM.
2. Setup a Resource-based policy such that:
  - S3 bucket API calls are allowed or denied for all or specific buckets/objects.
  - Bucket wide policy allows users or cross accounts to access all buckets.
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) allows users to specific objects in a bucket.
  - Bucket ACL allows users to specific buckets.
3. Setup encryption to encrypt objects in an S3 bucket.
4. Block public access at:
  - account level; OR
  - bucket level; OR
  - resource level.

For example, a bucket policy that allows public reads to all objects in a specific S3 bucket, e.g. `examplebucket`:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
